## Bio


I recently defended my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Penn State University</a>, where I work under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://dajiangliu.blog/" target="_blank">Dajiang Liu</a>. My research is centered on statistical genetics, functional genomics, and data science.

In the summer of 2023, I gained valuable experience as a Research Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/" target="_blank">Calico</a>, a subsidiary of Alphabet, where I worked with Dr. <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/people/madeleine-cule-ph-d/" target="_blank">Madeleine Cule</a> and her team.

Before starting my Ph.D. program, I earned a master’s degree in Biostatistics from <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/" target="_blank">Georgetown University</a>, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TRqVAAW/ao-yuan" target="_blank">Ao Yuan</a> and <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TfIDAA0/ming-tan" target="_blank">Ming Tan</a>. I got my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Southern University of Science and Technology</a>, where I was mentored by Prof. <a href="https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/teacher/TIAN,Guoliang?lang=en-us" target="_blank">Guoliang Tian</a>.


## Research Interests
- How can regulatory effects be modeled and assessed at single-cell resolution?
- How can genetics and clinical data be leveraged to prevent disease progression?
- How can genetics and multi-omics data be utilized to inform drug development?
